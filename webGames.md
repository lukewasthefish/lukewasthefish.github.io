### Try some games
To see games I have on the web, the best place to go is my itch.io page -> [click me!](https://lukewasthefish.itch.io)<br>
<br>
Some are download only, to check just see if it says 'play in browser' on the thumbnail.<br>

If so, you're good to go!<br>
<br>
Otherwise simply download and extract the zip file.<br>
